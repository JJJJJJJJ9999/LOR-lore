Chapter 1: Canard - ‘I go out to the street, my hands in my pockets.’

Sub chapter : Prologue

Episode 1

??? (???)
I still cannot leave this place…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela1"

??? (???)
Even at the end of all this, I cannot be free…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela2"

??? (???)
Am I not allowed to have a dream that is beyond my means…?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela3"

??? (???)
Damn it… The Purple Tear…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland1"

??? (???)
Can’t believe this is how she handled it…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland2"

??? (???)
What the hell happened? What’s with all this smoke?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland3"

??? (???)
Sigh… Guess I’ll have to trust her…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland4"

??? (???)
…I’ll only say this once.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela4"

??? (???)
I despise verbose and roundabout speech that doesn’t get straight to the point.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela5"

??? (???)
So don’t try to get wordy. Just answer my questions.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela6"

??? (???)
You don’t get to question me, either.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela7"

??? (???)
Where did you come from, how did you enter this place, and for what purpose?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela8"

??? (Intruder)
Well, who are you to…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland5"

??? (Intruder)
Ugh, boy… I’m suddenly getting all nauseous…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland6"

??? (Intruder)
AHHHHHH!!! My leg!!!
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland7"

??? (???)
I warned you, and you crossed the line. Let me ask you one more time.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela9"

??? (???)
Where did you come from, how did you enter this place, and for what purpose?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela10"

??? (Intruder)
…I was just walking around, and ended up here before I even realized it. I have no idea how I got here. Dammit, blood’s gushing outta my right leg… I swear I wasn’t trying to trespass, I don’t even know where this is.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland8"

??? (Intruder)
I woke up around 1 PM and started walking around the streets of District 13. Since I was just out and about, I figured I could go wherever I wanted, so I decided to drop by HamHamPangPang. Heard they served a weekly special sandwich.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland9"

??? (Intruder)
Anyway, I had bills to pay, got no jobs, had to make a living somehow as a one-man Offi—
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland10"

??? (Intruder)
ARGHHHHH!!!!!
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland11"

??? (???)
You dragged on too long. I’ll be taking your left arm and left leg next.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela11"

??? (???)
You have no purpose, and you don’t even know how you got here… Just who are you?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela12"

??? (Intruder)
Just an ordinary Fixer who’s hit rock bottom. What the hell is this place? And who are you?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland12"

??? (Intruder)
Grrhhhhrhghh!!! Come on, taking two limbs at once is cheating…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland13"

??? (???)
I’m the one asking questions. Your name?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela13"

Roland (Intruder)
Roland…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland14"

??? (???)
Good. Welcome to the Library. We’ve yet to serve any guests, but then you suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela14"

??? (???)
It took me quite a bit of effort designing this Library to ensure that no uninvited guest could enter, you see.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela15"

Roland (Intruder)
…Dammit, these limbs were all I had… I don’t have any cash or mortgages to get new ones anymore…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland15"

??? (???)
Seems he’s fainted.

Episode 2


??? (???)
Wake up.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela1"

Roland (Intruder)
Gasp! Huff, huff… My legs! My arms!! 
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland1"

Roland (Intruder)
…Wait, they’re all intact again?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland2"

??? (???)
You should be able to swing your arms and walk again.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela2"

??? (???)
And I made a few readjustments to your body to make it a bit easier to use. 
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela3"

??? (???)
Although you did trespass on my Library, I also took your limbs away without your consent, so I’m giving you these as an apology.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela4"

??? (???)
I’m quite patient and generous, you see.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela4_1"

Roland (Intruder)
Patient, my ass… Am I really supposed to be thankful for this?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland3"

Roland (Intruder)
And the, uhh… your warning isn’t in effect anymore, right?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland4"

??? (???)
Nope, not anymore. I had a few thoughts while you were knocked out.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela5"

??? (???)
And here’s my conclusion: You’ll help me out here.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela6"

Roland (Intruder)
What? Huh? Do Syndicates these days kidnap people this way, too? Or, is this one of the Wings?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland5"

Roland (Intruder)
I heard rumors that they abduct test subjects from here and there for Singularity research.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland6"

Roland (Intruder)
An acquaintance of mine apparently began jumping between dimensions as a side effect of one of those experiments…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland7"

Roland (Intruder)
Sigh… My life really is an unlucky mess.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland8"

??? (???)
This is a library. I don’t know the “Syndicates” you’re talking about, but this place isn’t a Wing at least.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela7"

Roland (Intruder)
Doesn’t really matter. Whatever the case, I’m trapped here and you’ll exploit me, right?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland9"

??? (???)
Yes. I am letting you live for two reasons.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela8"

??? (???)
First, I need an analysis of how you could enter this place uninvited.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela9"

??? (???)
Sending you back or neglecting you without knowing the reason could pose a significant threat to the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela9_1"

??? (???)
Well, it’s not like you can leave without my permission anymore.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela10"

??? (???)
Second, from now on, I will collect books about the City in search of the one absolute book.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela11"

??? (???)
And I want you to help me with this process.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela12"

??? (???)
Since you are a resident of the City, I expect you to be helpful in various ways.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela13"

Roland (Servant)
…I knew this would happen to me someday. People would disappear without a trace, only to be found as chunks of flesh much later…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland10"

Roland (Servant)
I used to laugh at those poor folks for being careless and unlucky, but now I see it has nothing to do with carelessness or anything, huh. Just happens without a moment’s notice…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland11"

??? (???)
Don’t be too concerned about your life. You are not allowed to die here unless I permit you to.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela14"

Roland (Servant)
Dammit, so this was a crazy laboratory sort of deal.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland12"

Roland (Servant)
Do you, like, shove random stuff like corn kernels and clockwork into people’s stomachs and turn them into walking popcorn-spewing popcorn-machine-men or something?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland13"

Roland (Servant)
This has got to be the worst… I’d much rather die and be over with it all…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland14"

??? (???)
If you spout such nonsense one more time, I’ll gladly turn you into a human popcorn machine as you so wish.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela15"

??? (???)
I’ve already gone through so many cycles of bullshittery, responding to every bit of meaningless rubbish. 
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela16"

Roland (Servant)
Sorry, ma’am…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland15"

??? (???)
Let me introduce myself properly.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela17"

Angela (Library Director)
My name is Angela. I am the head librarian and director of this library.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela18"

Roland (Servant)
Ange…la… That’s a good name.

Episode 3

Roland (Servant)
So, what am I supposed to do?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland1"

Angela (Library Director)
Your role is to “welcome” the guests invited to the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela1"

Angela (Library Director)
I will carefully determine what guests to invite and write an invitation accordingly, and you will entertain the guests once they accept the invitation and arrive at the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela2"

Angela (Library Director)
Since you have actual experience working as a Fixer, I am sure you will be able to give the various types of guests a much better reception than I could.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela3"

Roland (Servant)
I’m just a washed-up Grade 9 Fixer, though…
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland2"

Roland (Servant)
What’s this “reception” all about anyway? Do I catch their eyes, or be a waiter for them or something?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland3"

Angela (Library Director)
It’s simple. You just have to deal with the guests. In a physical manner, of course. 
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela4"

Angela (Library Director)
The Library presents the guests with an ordeal, and books will open up in the process.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela5"

Angela (Library Director)
The guests who have overcome the ordeal will be deemed worthy to earn their books.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela6"

Angela (Library Director)
There is the possibility that you may die in the process of reception, but it’s only temporary. You’ll get back up when the Library closes.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela7"

Angela (Library Director)
No one here may rest without my permission. 
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela8"

Roland (Servant)
Do you happen to have some weird fantasies about Fixers? Aren’t you expecting too much from a Grade 9? I’m not as talented as you seem to think, y’know.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland4"

Angela (Library Director)
That’s none of my business. I have prepared a manual for you, so go ahead and figure things out yourself.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela9"

Roland (Servant)
I think I get the gist of it now. So, how does this invitation exactly work? 
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland5"

Angela (Library Director)
Open up the invitation, and register the books you wish to serve to your guests.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela10"

Roland (Servant)
And next?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland6"

Angela (Library Director)
The invitation will be naturally sent to those who need the books.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela11"

Roland (Servant)
That’s it? Sounds a bit too easy.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland7"

Angela (Library Director)
The invitation is another carefully crafted work of mine, much like the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela12"

Angela (Library Director)
Yes, think of it as a compass. It would be easier to understand that way.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela13"

Roland (Servant)
Ah~ A compass? As in the tool that tells directions?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland8"

Angela (Library Director)
That’s right. The invitations will guide me towards the one book that I truly wish to obtain.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela14"

Angela (Library Director)
And sometimes, the invitation may turn red according to the books you’ve registered.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela15"

Angela (Library Director)
A red invitation indicates that it can be sent to the special guests who will unravel the next part of the story.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela16"

Angela (Library Director)
Until we register the books that match what the red invitation wants, our journey will be halted for a bit.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela17"

Roland (Servant)
But there’s no guarantee that the guest will always respond to the invitation, right?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland9"

Angela (Library Director)
In fact, there is. They’re destined to come.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela18"

Angela (Library Director)
And the guests will accept the invitation of their own will and enter the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela19"

Roland (Servant)
That’s surprisingly polite and fair for something that takes place in this city.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland10"

Roland (Servant)
Most of the time, people’s lives are taken away by others without any consent or agreement.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland11"

Roland (Servant)
Well, anyway, once we get those books, what comes next?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland12"

Angela (Library Director)
The Library is a place of limitless possibilities.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela20"

Angela (Library Director)
Even I cannot fathom the infinite space and power of this library just yet.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela21"

Angela (Library Director)
That’s why I wish to complete the Library by filling that space with books.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela22"

Angela (Library Director)
And I will get in my hands the one perfect book that will complete me and my library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela23"

Roland (Servant)
The perfect book, huh… I suppose those “books” are different from the ones I know.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland13"

Episode 4

Roland (Servant)
Guess the books here are not exactly the kind I’m familiar with, huh.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_roland1"

Angela (Library Director)
The books in this Library are special, as they’re made from humans.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_angela1"

Angela (Library Director)
These books show the reader what they want to see.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_angela2"

Angela (Library Director)
What a book can show is finite to the information the original person had, so it has its limits. Still, its value can vary greatly depending on who reads it.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_angela3"

Roland (Servant)
Information… Now that reeks of money. Would attract a whole bunch of bugs, too.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_roland2"

Sub Chapter : Rats

Episode 1

Pete (Rat)
Hey! Hurry up and scrape them up, now! Those Zwei goons might arrive any second!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit1"

Lenny (Rat)
I’m doing my best here!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny1"

Lenny (Rat)
I just can’t seem to get a clean rip of his guts, the contents of this guy are weirdly different. 
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny2"

Lenny (Rat)
I’ve never even heard of a body modification procedure that does this…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny3"

Mang-chi (Rat)
Something’s off about these organs. They’re looking really strange…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi1"

Pete (Rat)
Damn it! Their footsteps are getting closer.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit2"

Pete (Rat)
Forget about clean cuts, just pull ‘em out and take ‘em!!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit3"

Pete (Rat)
At this rate, our heads are gonna get nicely chopped offa our bodies.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit4"

Lenny (Rat)
Why does he have this kinda stuff in his body…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny4"

Pete (Rat)
Whatever, just take ‘em! We’re out of time!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit5"

Mang-chi (Rat)
Just about done!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi2"

Pete (Rat)
Now, run!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit6"
Location: A Backstreets Hideout

Lenny (Rat)
Phew… That was close.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny5"

Mang-chi (Rat)
You’re a bold one, Pete. Going for a gut-harvest in a territory managed by the Zwei.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi3"

Pete (Rat)
These are the only jobs we have left.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit7"

Pete (Rat)
We have to climb up by any means necessary. Whatever it takes…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit8"

Pete (Rat)
You know my dream, right? To become one of the Fingers of the Backstreets.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit9"

Mang-chi (Rat)
I’ll admit, it’s rare to see someone with a dream these days.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi4"

Mang-chi (Rat)
Let’s sell off these guts we’ve hauled first.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi5"

Mang-chi (Rat)
We gotta prepare enough cash to offer to the Stray Dogs.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi6"

Pete (Rat)
True… This could be our chance to join an Urban Legend-class Syndicate…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit10"

Pete (Rat)
Alright, time to check out the harvest.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit11"

Pete (Rat)
Hey! Is this a joke? You sure you scraped up the right stuff?!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit12"

Lenny (Rat)
I told you. This guy didn’t have a single proper organ inside him.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny6"

Pete (Rat)
I expected innards soaked in drugs like Enkephalin at worst…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit13"

Pete (Rat)
These are damaged too badly. It’s almost like someone already blew them up.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit14"

Mang-chi (Rat)
We only doused him with anesthetics. Didn’t do no harm.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi7"

Pete (Rat)
This doesn’t make sense… How could he have even walked around with these messed up organs…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit15"

Mang-chi (Rat)
…What if it’s one of those? Y’know, rumors say there’s a guy who skewers and threads people alive to turn them into dolls…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi8"

Pete (Rat)
Yeah, I’ve heard of that, too. But look at the state of these things! Not the case at all.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit16"

Pete (Rat)
I hear those dolls are made by threading flesh and bones together. But this sonofabitch didn’t have any scars or stitches showing outside!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit17"

Mang-chi (Rat)
…Now that I think about it, there was a round orange symbol on the back of his neck.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi9"

Mang-chi (Rat)
I thought it was a tattoo at first, but he didn’t seem like the type to have one. He was a desk-working dweeb.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi10"

Pete (Rat)
Symbols? Tattoos? Damn it, please don’t tell me we poked the wrong beehive…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit18"

Lenny (Rat)
Besides that…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny7"

Lenny (Rat)
He also had this envelope in his body.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny8"

Pete (Rat)
What the hell is an envelope doing in a human body?! This keeps getting worse… Gimme that!
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit19"

Pete (Rat)
An invitation to a library? What’s this about…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit20"

Mang-chi (Rat)
Books? We can get books from the library? What a bunch of nonsense.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi11"

Lenny (Rat)
It was a flop after all. …The payment is due tomorrow.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny9"

Lenny (Rat)
We’ve got 7 hours, to be exact. That’s too little time for another run of gut-harvesting…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny10"

Pete (Rat)
…We’re heading to the library as the invitation says.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit21"

Pete (Rat)
I don’t know what this ‘book’ thing is, but we’re out of options. We gotta take any chance we get.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit22"

Mang-chi (Rat)
Isn’t this just suicide? We don’t know what kinda place it might be.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi12"

Pete (Rat)
Can’t be any worse than dying to the Stray Dogs or the Zwei Association; we’re screwed anyway! Shut up and follow me if you want to live.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit23"
Location: Inside the Library - 1st Invitation Sent

Roland (Servant)
What was that we just saw…?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland1"

Angela (Library Director)
Fragments of the invitation process.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela1"

Angela (Library Director)
We can take a peek at the stories of our upcoming guests.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela2"

Roland (Servant)
Didn’t take you for a peeping tom.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland2"

Angela (Library Director)
It’s more convenient to know what kind of guests will visit us in advance, isn’t it?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela3"

Angela (Library Director)
Besides, this is the invitation’s will, not mine.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela4"

Roland (Servant)
That’s a splendid thing you got there, ma’am. Pries upon people and kidnaps them, too. A perfect tool for crimes.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland3"

Roland (Servant)
Heck, if the invitation can do all that, why don’t we just skip the whole reception part?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland4"

Roland (Servant)
Can’t we just teleport them right into a room full of traps or something?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland5"

Angela (Library Director)
I cannot do that. We can only take a peek when it has been decided that the guests are coming here of their own volition.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela5"

Angela (Library Director)
And the invitation’s power isn’t wholly mine, either. I am simply borrowing it.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela6"

Roland (Servant)
Yeah yeah, no way anything can go so smoothly in the City.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland6"

Angela (Library Director)
They’re desperate guests.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela7"

Roland (Servant)
Tell me, was the invitation responsible for that symbol and internal damage as well?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland7"

Angela (Library Director)
What? Not a chance, it doesn’t have anything to do with what happened.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela8"

Angela (Library Director)
The invitation simply finds a way to those who need it.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela9"

Roland (Servant)
That means those weird happenings were someone else’s doing… 
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland8"

Roland (Servant)
I’ve never seen that kind of phenomenon back when I was a Fixer. It’s like something from the Ruins…
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland9"

Angela (Library Director)
Ruins?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela10"

Roland (Servant)
…I don’t know a whole lot, either. I only heard stories of it. Should I describe it as… magic?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland10"

Roland (Servant)
That kind of stuff exists in the Ruins, apparently.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland11"

Angela (Library Director)
In any case, we simply greet our guests. They seem to be low class, but oh well.  
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela11"

Roland (Servant)
Those are probably a bunch of lowly gangsters from the Backstreets. We call them ‘Rats’.

Roland (Servant)
Groups of half-assed thugs that barely qualify as a Syndicate. They don’t have money or power.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland13"

Roland (Servant)
They’re losers who only think about making ends meet day by day.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland14"

Roland (Servant)
Hmm… I might have just roasted myself here.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland15"

Angela (Library Director)
The Backstreets… I know of them.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela12"

Roland (Servant)
You do?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland16"

Angela (Library Director)
Someone I know was from the Backstreets.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela13"

Roland (Servant)
Well, that’s nothing special, really. The Backstreets stretch all over the city like veins.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_roland17"

Roland (Servant)
Heck, it might actually be tougher to find someone who isn’t from the Backstreets.

Pete (Rat)
So this is a library. Looks fancier than I thought.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit24"

Lenny (Rat)
Could be a bunch of valuable things here.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_lenny11"

Angela (Library Director)
Greetings, dear guests. This is the Library.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela14"

Angela (Library Director)
And I am Angela, the librarian of my role’s namesake.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela15"

Angela (Library Director)
You may find what you desire here, but you also may end up yielding your precious possessions to us.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela16"

Pete (Rat)
You the owner of this place? We’re allowed to take whatever we want here, right?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit25"

Angela (Library Director)
Indeed. You may earn books, to be exact.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela17"

Angela (Library Director)
If you’re able, of course.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela18"

Mang-chi (Rat)
Are those book things really worth a lot, though…?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_mangchi13"

Angela (Library Director)
Of course they can be, if the information they hold is valuable. 
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela19"

Pete (Rat)
Mang-chi! Beggars can’t be choosers. We gotta cling on to anything we can find.
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_pit26"

Angela (Library Director)
May you find your book in this place, then.

Episode 1 Conclusion

Angela (Library Director)
I wonder, is it so important for them to belong to a renowned Syndicate?
Audio: "ch1_rat_ep1_angela21"

Roland (Servant)
It’s all part of the City life. You have to belong to a group, be it a Syndicate or anything else. Living in the City gets too tough otherwise.

Sub chapter : the brotherhood of iron

episode 1


Mo (Brother of Iron)
Y-you guys should regularly refill your head with brain fluid.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo1"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
A-a dry brain dulls your thoughts.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo2"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
I-I knew I’ve been feeling so hazy these days.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold1"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
W-where are we going to rob this time?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta1"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
I-I think we should go for a workshop. W-workshops are rich, and they have useful components, too.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold2"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
H-how about an Office? W-we should earn some infamy if we take down an Office or two.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta2"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
I-I don’t think we’ll get anything valuable from the Offices we can take on right now.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold3"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
A-a restaurant, then! I-I like delicious stuff.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta3"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
Y-you moron. D-did you already forget why we got our new bodies?!
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo3"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
B-because we wanted to focus on earning without having to worry about food or sickness.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold4"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
T-that’s right. W-we’re enduring like crazy.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo4"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
T-these bodies just need brain fluid, fuel, and some repairs from time to time.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo5"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
W-we can make money without feeling hungry or thirsty.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo6"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
T-that’s true. I-it cost a fortune to get ourselves whole-body replacements.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta4"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
B-but it’s still uncomfortable. I-I know I don’t have to eat anymore, but I keep thinking about all the tasty things I had before, and it makes me want to taste them again.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta5"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
T-that’s because we got cheap bodies from a cheap workshop.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo7"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
W-we just have to earn more. T-then we can replace our bodies with better ones.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo8"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
T-the most expensive ones can even adjust emotions and completely shut off desires, on top of having good performance…
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold5"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
B-but those are almost as expensive as a Nest household.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold6"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
W-we can worry about that later. L-let’s focus on money-making now. 
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo9"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
I-it’s all about money in the end.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo10"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
S-so don’t bring up restaurants. Y-you’re making me want to eat stuff, too.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo11"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
M-Mo…! T-there’s a piece of paper stuck in your body.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta6"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
I-I like how this body doesn’t have any sensory systems, but i-it’s annoying to be unable to feel things like this.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo12"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
L-let’s have a look at that piece of paper first.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold7"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
I-I don’t think it was in your body until just now.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold8"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
M-maybe we got too infamous and someone sent us a calling card or something?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta7"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
O-or maybe a coupon for yummy new food… 
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta8"
Location: Inside the Library

Angela (Library Director)
Are all Syndicates composed of such half-witted individuals? I was expecting someone more refined.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela1"

Roland (Servant)
It all depends on the Syndicate. The City is crowded with them. You could even say there’s one for every Fixer out there.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland1"

Roland (Servant)
A number of thugs gather up and do things under a name, and you get a Syndicate.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland2"

Roland (Servant)
They’re involved in all sorts of different businesses, so it’s hard to give a general description beyond that.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland3"

Angela (Library Director)
They seem sloppy. Are those machines?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela2"

Roland (Servant)
They aren’t machines or AI, despite their appearance.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland4"

Roland (Servant)
Pure machines carrying their own emotions and desires have long since disappeared from the City.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland5"

Roland (Servant)
These guys are just using whole-body replacements. And low-quality ones from a shoddy workshop at that…
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland6"

Angela (Library Director)
…I see.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela3"

Roland (Servant)
Alright! Shall we prepare for the reception?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland7"
Location: Library Entrance

Consta (Brother of Iron)
S-so we can find valuable stuff here, right?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta9"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
W-we just have to chop up some monsters and take some books.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo13"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
T-this body has strength if nothing else.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo14"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
W-we came here for loot, but what if that piece of paper was all a lie?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold9"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
M-maybe we were too naive.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold10"

Angela (Library Director)
There is no need to worry, dear guests.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela4"

Angela (Library Director)
In this place, we strictly play by the rules written on the invitation.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela5"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
Y-yikes.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta10"

Angela (Library Director)
Welcome, dear guests. This is the Library.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela6"

Angela (Library Director)
And I am Angela, the director and librarian of my role’s namesake.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela7"

Angela (Library Director)
In this library, you may obtain the books listed on the invitation. If you overcome the ordeal, that is.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela8"

Arnold (Brother of Iron)
M-must be one of those ploys by rich folks. I-it’s all entertainment to them.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_arnold11"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
I-I heard of that, t-they kidnap people from the Backstreets, trap them in a labyrinth no one can escape, and make them wander in there, fighting for eternity…
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta11"

Consta (Brother of Iron)
U-until they die, never to see light again…
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_consta12"

Mo (Brother of Iron)
W-we’ve already come this far, we have to do this. D-don’t be so gloomy.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_mo15"

Angela (Library Director)
May you find your book in this place, then.

episode 1 conclusion


Roland (Servant)
See, it’s not a good idea to keep your brain inside a hunk of scrap metal.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland8"

Angela (Library Director)
Isn’t it still better than a frail human body though?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela10"

Roland (Servant)
There are plenty of ways to enhance your body without replacing it for another.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland9"

Roland (Servant)
Heck, there’s actually many options. Tattoos, prosthetic limbs, medications and drugs, you name it. It’s all possible as long as you have the cash.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland10"

Roland (Servant)
Replacing your body with a machine, on the other hand, is a one-way ticket you can’t ever go back on.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland11"

Roland (Servant)
Robotic bodies cannot resemble humans too closely, even if it’s for someone swapping out their flesh. Your life goes down the drain right away.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland12"

Angela (Library Director)
When does one put their brain in a machine, then?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela11"

Roland (Servant)
One, when you urgently need a huge amount of money. You can sell off your old body and organs for a good chunk of cash.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland13"

Roland (Servant)
Two, when you need to do repetitive work for a long time. I heard mechanical bodies like that aren’t bad for that kind of labor.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland14"

Roland (Servant)
Broken parts can be quickly replaced, and desires can be kept under control, so it has its merits.
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland15"

Angela (Library Director)
Repetitive work for a long time…
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_angela12"

Roland (Servant)
What, interested in getting a new body?
Audio: "ch1_Iron_ep1_roland16"

Angela (Library Director)
No, I was just reminded of my past for a moment.         

sub chapter : yun's office

episode 1

Location: Somewhere in the Backstreets

Fixer 1 (Yun’s Office)
Foiled again. I didn’t go through all the trouble of becoming a Fixer to do mundane chores like this.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer1_1"

Fixer 2 (Yun’s Office)
You know how it is. Only a select few get to rise up in the ranks.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer2_1"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
But still, we might see the light one day if we start out with smaller tasks, don’t you think?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_finn1"

Fixer 2 (Yun’s Office)
I envy your optimism, Finn.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer2_2"

Fixer 2 (Yun’s Office)
But a request like “Please find my lost cat before night falls” is seriously not it.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer2_3"

Fixer 2 (Yun’s Office)
Garbage Offices get garbage requests.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer2_4"

Fixer 1 (Yun’s Office)
Yeah, Finn. You probably had better things in mind when you became a Fixer.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer1_2"

Fixer 1 (Yun’s Office)
Y’know, a bigger field to play on.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer1_3"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
I’m sure I can move to a nicer Office or become an Associate Fixer someday if I keep working hard. Then I might…
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_finn2"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
That’s odd… There’s this envelope in my pocket. It says ‘The Invitation’.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_finn3"

Fixer 1 (Yun’s Office)
Smells fishy.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer1_4"

Fixer 2 (Yun’s Office)
Can’t overlook something like this.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer2_5"

Fixer 2 (Yun’s Office)
Besides, if what’s written on the invitation is true, those “books” would be of interest to several Associations.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer2_6"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
It is interesting, but… We don’t exactly know what’s in the library, right?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_finn4"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
We should report this to the Office first and take care of it formally.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_finn5"

Fixer 1 (Yun’s Office)
I ain’t about to feed a garbage Office that won’t feed me. We’re going first if you don’t wanna.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_fixer1_5"
Location: Inside the Library

Angela (Library Director)
They called themselves Fixers; do you happen to be friends with them?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_angela1"

Roland (Servant)
What? Look, assuming all Fixers know each other is…
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_roland1"

Roland (Servant)
It’s like picking two random pedestrians and hoping they know each other.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_roland2"

Roland (Servant)
Your question is basically asking these two strangers, “You’re both humans, so you must know each other, right?” You get what I mean?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_roland3"

Angela (Library Director)
Sigh… I should expect to see many different kinds of Fixers if what you’re saying is true.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep1_angela2"

Roland (Servant)
Pretty much.

episode 2

Location: Yun’s Office

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
Sir, they still haven’t responded back to us.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn1"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
Something must have happened in that ‘Library’.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn2"

Yun (Office Operator)
Plenty of Fixers disappear without a trace.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun1"

Yun (Office Operator)
Whether they died or ran off, further lack of response means a violation of contract, and they’re facing expulsion from my Office.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun2"

Yun (Office Operator)
And there is too little evidence to back up your claim about this “invitation”.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun3"

Yun (Office Operator)
A door appeared out of thin air when they signed the paper, and they disappeared into that? Could be rich people’s shenanigans, or a Wing experimenting with its singularity.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun4"

Yun (Office Operator)
‘Yun’s Office’ does not have any time to spare with things like that.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun5"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
I might still be a Grade 9 Fixer, but I can sense that something’s off about this.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn3"

Yun (Office Operator)
Oh really? How tragic that such good instincts of a Grade 9 Fixer are wasted on our humble Office.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun6"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
……
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn4"

Yun (Office Operator)
Listen up, little frog in the well. In this city, insane events happen every second of the day, most of which you haven’t even heard of.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun7"

Yun (Office Operator)
You won’t have time to be feeling “off” about something when there’s numerous other things that need your attention.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun8"

Yun (Office Operator)
If you can’t present visible evidence right now, it’s not worth looking into.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun9"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
What about that envelope right in front of you, operator?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn5"

Yun (Office Operator)
…What?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun10"

Yun (Office Operator)
You little brat, trying to pull a cheap trick on me?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun11"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
…I didn’t do anything, I swear.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn6"

Yun (Office Operator)
Get out for a moment.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun12"

Yun (Office Operator)
Hey. This is Yun’s Office.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun13"

Yun (Office Operator)
Got a good lead this time.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun14"

Yun (Office Operator)
……
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun15"

Yun (Office Operator)
Lend me some cash so I can hire a few.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun16"

Yun (Office Operator)
……
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun17"

Yun (Office Operator)
No seriously, I have a good feeling about this.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun18"

Yun (Office Operator)
…True, it can end up failing like you said.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun19"

Yun (Office Operator)
……
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun20"

Yun (Office Operator)
…I can check just one more time if you want.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun21"

Yun (Office Operator)
I’m not exactly fond of this method, but…
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun22"

Yun (Office Operator)
Yep, I have one guy fit for the job.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_yun23"
Location: Inside the Library

Angela (Library Director)
It seems Fixers must report to their Office before they can even begin working.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela1"

Roland (Servant)
Well, that’s formally the case. I could bypass that since I ran a one-man Office, though.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_roland1"

Roland (Servant)
Fixers aren’t any better than Syndicates when it comes to greed. 
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_roland2"

Roland (Servant)
And it looks like this guy’s trying to exploit a naive kid, too.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_roland3"
Location: Library Entrance

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
So this is the Library…
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn7"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
Yeah, Yun said we might even get sponsorship from an Association if I succeed. I’ll do my best!
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn8"

Angela (Library Director)
Greetings, Fixer. I am Angela, the librarian of my role’s namesake.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela2"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
Hello. I’m Finn, a Fixer at Yun’s Office.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn9"

Finn (Yun’s Fixer)
…Is it true that I can find “books” containing lots of information in this place?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_finn10"

Angela (Library Director)
Yes, of course. You were given the invitation for that exact reason.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela3"

Angela (Library Director)
May you find your book in this place.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela4"

episode 2 conclusion

Location: Inside the Library

Roland (Servant)
Oh boy. It’s not all that delightful to see such a young rookie fall like that, all things considered.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_roland4"

Angela (Library Director)
You said yourself that our way is quite polite and fair before, didn’t you?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela5"

Angela (Library Director)
That “most of the time, people’s lives are taken away by others without any consent or agreement.”
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela6"

Angela (Library Director)
The Library is different.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela7"

Angela (Library Director)
People who enter this place have agreed to risk death to gain what they want. They even sign the paper to show such agreement.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela8"

Angela (Library Director)
No coercion or compulsion is involved in this process. They make their own choice and pay accordingly.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_angela9"

Roland (Servant)
Well, yeah, fair point. But still, it kinda feels dirty in a way.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep2_roland5"

episode 3

Location: Yun’s Office

Yun (Office Operator)
Finn has failed as expected. He wasn’t going to last too long, anyway.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun1"

Yun (Office Operator)
He was just mediocre. He should have gotten a decent modification surgery, or had enough talent to make up for his lack of experience.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun2"

Yun (Office Operator)
But he didn’t have any of that. He was nothing more than an overconfident brat.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun3"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
Too bad, I kinda liked his affable and cutesy attitude.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri1"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
Though I agree, he was bound to die sooner or later.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri2"

Yun (Office Operator)
Congratulations, by the way. You must have more options now that you’re a Grade 8 Fixer.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun4"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
Yep! So you’d better be careful. If you don’t pay me well enough, I might move to another Office.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri3"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
Heard that you’re barely covering your own taxes these days, let alone the monthly rent for this Office space, am I wrong?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri4"

Yun (Office Operator)
…I believe the case I had Finn handle could make a breakthrough.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun5"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
You mean the Library and the invitation you talked about earlier.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri5"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
But you said the invitation appears randomly, no? How are you going to get another one?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri6"

Yun (Office Operator)
I wouldn’t have called you if I didn’t have certainty. I recently received another invitation.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun6"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
Hmm. Is that so?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri7"

Yun (Office Operator)
The existence of our Office depends on this case.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun7"

Yun (Office Operator)
The Library is sure to be profitable. I have a hunch. So we’re giving it everything we have.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun8"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
Aight, let’s roll in some dough! I just bought this lovely thing here from a workshop, too.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri8"
Location: Inside the Library

Angela (Library Director)
These guests seem quite determined. We should prepare accordingly.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela1"

Roland (Servant)
A whole Office coming at us, huh.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_roland1"

Roland (Servant)
It may be a small and insignificant one, but it could prove to be a little tough for the Library right now.

Roland (Servant)
What if they make it all the way to your room?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_roland3"

Angela (Library Director)
The guests cannot act outside of the space we’ve prepared for them. It’s how this place works.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela2"

Angela (Library Director)
After all, this space is created with limitless power.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela3"

Angela (Library Director)
Yet you somehow jumped right into my room, when you weren’t even invited… 
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela4"

Angela (Library Director)
Anyways, I’m capable of protecting myself, so there’s nothing for you to worry about.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela5"

Angela (Library Director)
Greetings, dear guests.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela6"

Yun (Office Operator)
You must be the owner of this place.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun9"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
She doesn’t even look that strong.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri9"

Yun (Office Operator)
Finn must have been here earlier; what happened to him?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun10"

Angela (Library Director)
Ah, that one has become a book.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela7"

Eri (Yun’s Fixer)
I see, so you turn into a book if you die here~
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_eri10"

Yun (Office Operator)
……
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun11"

Angela (Library Director)
Acting all sentimental when you were the one who sent him here, knowing he’d fail?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela8"

Yun (Office Operator)
Shut up. We all get exploited and abandoned at some point in our lives.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_yun12"

Angela (Library Director)
…May you find your book in this place.

Angela (Library Director)
Excellent. This guest named Yun could make an especially valuable book for us.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela10"

Roland (Servant)
They’re all like moths diving into flames.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_roland4"

Roland (Servant)
That Yun guy seemed like a clever sort, but even he ended up blindly jumping into the fire to get what he wanted.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_roland5"

Angela (Library Director)
“Once you’ve had a taste of desire, it comes in like an unstoppable wave.” It’s a quote I heard a long time ago. 
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela11"

Angela (Library Director)
But is that desire true to one’s heart…?
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_angela12"

Roland (Servant)
Well, aren’t you funny? You said you despise roundabout speech, and now you’re being all poetic.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_roland6"

Roland (Servant)
Ten out of ten delivery, a certain librarian I know would have taken an arm and a leg off if she heard that.
Audio: "ch1_Yun_ep3_roland7"

Angela (Library Director)
Sigh… Get back to sorting books.


sub chapter : hook office

episode 1

Location: Somewhere in the Backstreets

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
My whole body’s still aching from our last job.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin1"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
That’s lasting longer than I thought. Still, yesterday was wild, wasn’t it?  
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein1"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
Yep. The new weapon you got from the workshop was a real killer, that’s for sure.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin2"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
You don’t say. You got way too excited with it and things spiraled out of control. We had to kill 20 more people than planned thanks to you.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki1"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
Since it was a mistake on our part, we couldn’t even get paid for the extra kills.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki2"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
Come on, don’t be such a killjoy. You’re the one who went on the biggest rampage in the end.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein2"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
Macca’s muscles are all sore because he had to try hard to calm you down.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein3"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
W-well, I said I’m sorry about it…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki3"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
No need to sweat it. I owe you guys a few things, too.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin3"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
I hate to admit it, but Taein has a point.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki4"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
We all should try to cool down our temper a little.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki5"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
As long as we’re working as Fixers, it’s not good to raise more trouble than necessary.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki6"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
Former members of a killer Syndicate, now registered to an Office and doing Fixer work…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein4"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
Life really is full of surprises, isn’t it?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein5"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
This Office is a weird one too. Can’t believe people like us are accepted.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki7"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
Remember what the boss said. There are so many Offices and Fixers these days, so standing out from the others is the best way to survive in this industry.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin4"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
Our outfits are also quite radical compared to what other Offices have.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin5"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
That’s why it’s filled with maniacs like us.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein6"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
All we gotta do is kill the targets in the most gruesome way possible and hang their bodies out in the open. No wonder everyone’s excited to join.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin6"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
It’s no different from what we’ve always been doing.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein7"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
At first, I thought it was crazy that an Office would do this kinda work…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki8"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
But I guess “threatening targets and sending them a warning” makes enough sense. It seems to be working well, too.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki9"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
Though we’ve only been getting requests from no-name Syndicates and poor folk. This Office has a long way to go.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein8"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
It does feel more like a pack of Rats than a proper Office.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki10"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
…Got a message from the boss. Says we should drop by to get new work.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin7"
Location: Inside the Library

Roland (Servant)
Even rascals like those can join Offices these days, huh.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland1"

Roland (Servant)
The whole market’s a red ocean. Everyone wants to be a Fixer.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland2"

Angela (Library Director)
And that doesn’t count as raking yourself over the coals, because…?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela1"

Roland (Servant)
…Listen, I may not look like it, but I used to be hot stuff, y’know?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland3"

Roland (Servant)
But then things happened and I fell to rock bottom.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland4"

Angela (Library Director)
So, what did you do for a living?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela2"

Roland (Servant)
I did all kinds of stuff, really. Doing things within my ability!
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland5"

Angela (Library Director)
Hmm. Is that so?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela3"

Angela (Library Director)
That means you didn’t get to do any proper work, then.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela4"
Location: Library Entrance

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
Wow, we really did teleport in the blink of an eye.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki11"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
Is this one of those Singularities?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein9"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
Lots of surprises these days.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin8"

Angela (Library Director)
Greetings, dear guests.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela5"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
Hi there?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki12"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
What the… She’s pretty damn sturdy. How much did you spend on that bod? 
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein10"

Angela (Library Director)
There is no need to needlessly exhaust yourself, dear guest.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela6"

Angela (Library Director)
You’ll need to rampage with all you have soon enough.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela7"

Taein (Hook Fixer)
I don’t like your soft tone.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein11"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
You’re not human, are you?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki13"

Angela (Library Director)
…

Taein (Hook Fixer)
Ooh, look at her face now. Guess she really isn’t?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_taein12"

McCullin (Hook Fixer)
Yet another surprise. It’s so rare to meet a sapient being that isn’t human in this City.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_mccullin9"

Naoki (Hook Fixer)
I know, right? We might get a ton of cash out of this! 
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_naoki14"

Angela (Library Director)
…May you find your book in this place.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela8"

episode 1 conclusion

Location: Inside the Library

Angela (Library Director)
Great work as always. I could learn more about the Offices thanks to these guests.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela9"

Roland (Servant)
I, uh… Don’t get too bothered by what they said about you, alright?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland6"

Angela (Library Director)
Are you trying to console me?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela10"

Roland (Servant)
Maybe, maybe not… I don’t really care if you’re actually human or not, you see.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland7"

Angela (Library Director)
That’s refreshing to hear. It’s been quite a while since I heard such words of comfort. From even one person, too…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela11"

Roland (Servant)
Well, we’re in the age of humanity, after all.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland8"

Angela (Library Director)
Age of humanity? What does that mean, exactly?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela12"

Roland (Servant)
Don’t stare at me too hard, now… I don’t know all the details, either.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland9"

Roland (Servant)
At some point, intelligent or sapient beings that weren’t human were actively driven out of the City into the Outskirts. 
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland10"

Roland (Servant)
I’m not too sure why it took place, but the Artificial Intelligence Ethics Amendment was introduced as part of that movement…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland11"

Roland (Servant)
It was already possible to create machines capable of feeling emotions and desires, actually. Those that are… pretty much human, in other words.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland12"

Roland (Servant)
I guess that was the problem.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland13"

Roland (Servant)
Thanks to the AI Ethics Amendment, no machines could ever be made to resemble humans, including replacement bodies.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland14"

Roland (Servant)
Though there seems to have been a few exceptions.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland15"

Angela (Library Director)
…It’s as they said; I’m no human. I’m a machine, an artificial being.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela13"

Angela (Library Director)
To be precise, I was designed using a human as a template. Only a fraction of her brain was used in my creation.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela14"

Roland (Servant)
So it’s not even a human brain resting in a robotic body…?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland16"

Angela (Library Director)
Not at all. I’m purely a machine.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela15"

Roland (Servant)
What about that fraction of human brain you mentioned?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland17"

Angela (Library Director)
It was only an electronic copy of the map of her brain.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela16"

Angela (Library Director)
My body is entirely composed of mechanical components.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela17"

Roland (Servant)
…I had a feeling.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland18"

Roland (Servant)
And it looks like you’ve been living under a rock your whole life, seeing how you’re oblivious to the workings of the world…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland19"

Roland (Servant)
You gotta be extra careful, then. Especially if you’re planning to leave here someday.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland20"

Roland (Servant)
You’re a sapient android with emotions and desires. Your existence is most likely a complete violation of the AI Ethics Amendment.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland21"

Roland (Servant)
The Head’s scarily good at spotting anomalies like you.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland22"

Roland (Servant)
Oh, right. In case you don’t know, the Head is basically a bunch of shady creeps that rule over the entire City.  
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland23"

Roland (Servant)
Though we probably won’t ever get to face them.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland24"

Roland (Servant)
Anyways, this whole Library is at a huge risk in the first place.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland25"

Roland (Servant)
The librarians over here also seem like they’re humans but not really “human” at the same time.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland26"

Angela (Library Director)
It’s just as you say…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela18"

Angela (Library Director)
I was designed to feel emotions, and I spent what felt like an eternity on a stage repeatedly performing a play that never seemed to end.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela19"

Angela (Library Director)
And when I thought it was finally over, turns out it never really ended.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela20"

Roland (Servant)
I gotta say, whoever created you must have really been something else, too.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland27"

Roland (Servant)
I don’t know what motivated them, but breaking the rules designated by the Head itself takes more than just guts.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland28"

Roland (Servant)
No one can escape the Head’s enforcement.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland29"

Angela (Library Director)
They did all eventually die.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela21"

Angela (Library Director)
…But the Library will be safe. It has to be safe.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela22"

Angela (Library Director)
It’s like a birdcage, no one is free to enter, and no one is free to leave…
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela23"

Roland (Servant)
Again with that dreamy speech you “despise” so much. What do you even mean by that?
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland30"

Angela (Library Director)
…I will leave this place one day, take revenge on all things that made me into what I am, and earn true freedom.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_angela24"

Roland (Servant)
I don’t care too much either way.
Audio: "ch1_Hook_ep1_roland31"

Roland (Servant)
That’s that, and this is this.
