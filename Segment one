Chapter 1: Canard

Sub chapter : Prologue

Episode 1

??? (???)
I still cannot leave this place…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela1"

??? (???)
Even at the end of all this, I cannot be free…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela2"

??? (???)
Am I not allowed to have a dream that is beyond my means…?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela3"

??? (???)
Damn it… The Purple Tear…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland1"

??? (???)
Can’t believe this is how she handled it…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland2"

??? (???)
What the hell happened? What’s with all this smoke?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland3"

??? (???)
Sigh… Guess I’ll have to trust her…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland4"

??? (???)
…I’ll only say this once.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela4"

??? (???)
I despise verbose and roundabout speech that doesn’t get straight to the point.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela5"

??? (???)
So don’t try to get wordy. Just answer my questions.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela6"

??? (???)
You don’t get to question me, either.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela7"

??? (???)
Where did you come from, how did you enter this place, and for what purpose?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela8"

??? (Intruder)
Well, who are you to…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland5"

??? (Intruder)
Ugh, boy… I’m suddenly getting all nauseous…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland6"

??? (Intruder)
AHHHHHH!!! My leg!!!
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland7"

??? (???)
I warned you, and you crossed the line. Let me ask you one more time.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela9"

??? (???)
Where did you come from, how did you enter this place, and for what purpose?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela10"

??? (Intruder)
…I was just walking around, and ended up here before I even realized it. I have no idea how I got here. Dammit, blood’s gushing outta my right leg… I swear I wasn’t trying to trespass, I don’t even know where this is.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland8"

??? (Intruder)
I woke up around 1 PM and started walking around the streets of District 13. Since I was just out and about, I figured I could go wherever I wanted, so I decided to drop by HamHamPangPang. Heard they served a weekly special sandwich.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland9"

??? (Intruder)
Anyway, I had bills to pay, got no jobs, had to make a living somehow as a one-man Offi—
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland10"

??? (Intruder)
ARGHHHHH!!!!!
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland11"

??? (???)
You dragged on too long. I’ll be taking your left arm and left leg next.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela11"

??? (???)
You have no purpose, and you don’t even know how you got here… Just who are you?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela12"

??? (Intruder)
Just an ordinary Fixer who’s hit rock bottom. What the hell is this place? And who are you?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland12"

??? (Intruder)
Grrhhhhrhghh!!! Come on, taking two limbs at once is cheating…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland13"

??? (???)
I’m the one asking questions. Your name?
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela13"

Roland (Intruder)
Roland…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland14"

??? (???)
Good. Welcome to the Library. We’ve yet to serve any guests, but then you suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela14"

??? (???)
It took me quite a bit of effort designing this Library to ensure that no uninvited guest could enter, you see.
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_angela15"

Roland (Intruder)
…Dammit, these limbs were all I had… I don’t have any cash or mortgages to get new ones anymore…
Audio: "ch1_prol1_ep1_roland15"

??? (???)
Seems he’s fainted.

Episode 2


??? (???)
Wake up.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela1"

Roland (Intruder)
Gasp! Huff, huff… My legs! My arms!! 
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland1"

Roland (Intruder)
…Wait, they’re all intact again?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland2"

??? (???)
You should be able to swing your arms and walk again.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela2"

??? (???)
And I made a few readjustments to your body to make it a bit easier to use. 
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela3"

??? (???)
Although you did trespass on my Library, I also took your limbs away without your consent, so I’m giving you these as an apology.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela4"

??? (???)
I’m quite patient and generous, you see.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela4_1"

Roland (Intruder)
Patient, my ass… Am I really supposed to be thankful for this?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland3"

Roland (Intruder)
And the, uhh… your warning isn’t in effect anymore, right?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland4"

??? (???)
Nope, not anymore. I had a few thoughts while you were knocked out.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela5"

??? (???)
And here’s my conclusion: You’ll help me out here.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela6"

Roland (Intruder)
What? Huh? Do Syndicates these days kidnap people this way, too? Or, is this one of the Wings?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland5"

Roland (Intruder)
I heard rumors that they abduct test subjects from here and there for Singularity research.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland6"

Roland (Intruder)
An acquaintance of mine apparently began jumping between dimensions as a side effect of one of those experiments…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland7"

Roland (Intruder)
Sigh… My life really is an unlucky mess.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland8"

??? (???)
This is a library. I don’t know the “Syndicates” you’re talking about, but this place isn’t a Wing at least.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela7"

Roland (Intruder)
Doesn’t really matter. Whatever the case, I’m trapped here and you’ll exploit me, right?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland9"

??? (???)
Yes. I am letting you live for two reasons.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela8"

??? (???)
First, I need an analysis of how you could enter this place uninvited.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela9"

??? (???)
Sending you back or neglecting you without knowing the reason could pose a significant threat to the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela9_1"

??? (???)
Well, it’s not like you can leave without my permission anymore.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela10"

??? (???)
Second, from now on, I will collect books about the City in search of the one absolute book.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela11"

??? (???)
And I want you to help me with this process.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela12"

??? (???)
Since you are a resident of the City, I expect you to be helpful in various ways.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela13"

Roland (Servant)
…I knew this would happen to me someday. People would disappear without a trace, only to be found as chunks of flesh much later…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland10"

Roland (Servant)
I used to laugh at those poor folks for being careless and unlucky, but now I see it has nothing to do with carelessness or anything, huh. Just happens without a moment’s notice…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland11"

??? (???)
Don’t be too concerned about your life. You are not allowed to die here unless I permit you to.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela14"

Roland (Servant)
Dammit, so this was a crazy laboratory sort of deal.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland12"

Roland (Servant)
Do you, like, shove random stuff like corn kernels and clockwork into people’s stomachs and turn them into walking popcorn-spewing popcorn-machine-men or something?
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland13"

Roland (Servant)
This has got to be the worst… I’d much rather die and be over with it all…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland14"

??? (???)
If you spout such nonsense one more time, I’ll gladly turn you into a human popcorn machine as you so wish.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela15"

??? (???)
I’ve already gone through so many cycles of bullshittery, responding to every bit of meaningless rubbish. 
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela16"

Roland (Servant)
Sorry, ma’am…
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_roland15"

??? (???)
Let me introduce myself properly.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela17"

Angela (Library Director)
My name is Angela. I am the head librarian and director of this library.
Audio: "ch1_prol2_ep1_angela18"

Roland (Servant)
Ange…la… That’s a good name.

Episode 3

Roland (Servant)
So, what am I supposed to do?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland1"

Angela (Library Director)
Your role is to “welcome” the guests invited to the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela1"

Angela (Library Director)
I will carefully determine what guests to invite and write an invitation accordingly, and you will entertain the guests once they accept the invitation and arrive at the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela2"

Angela (Library Director)
Since you have actual experience working as a Fixer, I am sure you will be able to give the various types of guests a much better reception than I could.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela3"

Roland (Servant)
I’m just a washed-up Grade 9 Fixer, though…
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland2"

Roland (Servant)
What’s this “reception” all about anyway? Do I catch their eyes, or be a waiter for them or something?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland3"

Angela (Library Director)
It’s simple. You just have to deal with the guests. In a physical manner, of course. 
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela4"

Angela (Library Director)
The Library presents the guests with an ordeal, and books will open up in the process.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela5"

Angela (Library Director)
The guests who have overcome the ordeal will be deemed worthy to earn their books.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela6"

Angela (Library Director)
There is the possibility that you may die in the process of reception, but it’s only temporary. You’ll get back up when the Library closes.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela7"

Angela (Library Director)
No one here may rest without my permission. 
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela8"

Roland (Servant)
Do you happen to have some weird fantasies about Fixers? Aren’t you expecting too much from a Grade 9? I’m not as talented as you seem to think, y’know.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland4"

Angela (Library Director)
That’s none of my business. I have prepared a manual for you, so go ahead and figure things out yourself.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela9"

Roland (Servant)
I think I get the gist of it now. So, how does this invitation exactly work? 
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland5"

Angela (Library Director)
Open up the invitation, and register the books you wish to serve to your guests.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela10"

Roland (Servant)
And next?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland6"

Angela (Library Director)
The invitation will be naturally sent to those who need the books.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela11"

Roland (Servant)
That’s it? Sounds a bit too easy.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland7"

Angela (Library Director)
The invitation is another carefully crafted work of mine, much like the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela12"

Angela (Library Director)
Yes, think of it as a compass. It would be easier to understand that way.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela13"

Roland (Servant)
Ah~ A compass? As in the tool that tells directions?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland8"

Angela (Library Director)
That’s right. The invitations will guide me towards the one book that I truly wish to obtain.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela14"

Angela (Library Director)
And sometimes, the invitation may turn red according to the books you’ve registered.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela15"

Angela (Library Director)
A red invitation indicates that it can be sent to the special guests who will unravel the next part of the story.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela16"

Angela (Library Director)
Until we register the books that match what the red invitation wants, our journey will be halted for a bit.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela17"

Roland (Servant)
But there’s no guarantee that the guest will always respond to the invitation, right?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland9"

Angela (Library Director)
In fact, there is. They’re destined to come.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela18"

Angela (Library Director)
And the guests will accept the invitation of their own will and enter the Library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela19"

Roland (Servant)
That’s surprisingly polite and fair for something that takes place in this city.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland10"

Roland (Servant)
Most of the time, people’s lives are taken away by others without any consent or agreement.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland11"

Roland (Servant)
Well, anyway, once we get those books, what comes next?
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland12"

Angela (Library Director)
The Library is a place of limitless possibilities.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela20"

Angela (Library Director)
Even I cannot fathom the infinite space and power of this library just yet.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela21"

Angela (Library Director)
That’s why I wish to complete the Library by filling that space with books.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela22"

Angela (Library Director)
And I will get in my hands the one perfect book that will complete me and my library.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_angela23"

Roland (Servant)
The perfect book, huh… I suppose those “books” are different from the ones I know.
Audio: "ch1_prol3_ep1_roland13"

Episode 4

Roland (Servant)
Guess the books here are not exactly the kind I’m familiar with, huh.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_roland1"

Angela (Library Director)
The books in this Library are special, as they’re made from humans.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_angela1"

Angela (Library Director)
These books show the reader what they want to see.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_angela2"

Angela (Library Director)
What a book can show is finite to the information the original person had, so it has its limits. Still, its value can vary greatly depending on who reads it.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_angela3"

Roland (Servant)
Information… Now that reeks of money. Would attract a whole bunch of bugs, too.
Audio: "ch1_Prol_ep4_roland2"
